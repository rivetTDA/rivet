/**
 * \class	BifiltrationData
 * \brief	Computes and stores the information about a bifiltration needed to compute homology in fixed dimension hom_dim.  Together with Input_Manager, handles 1-critical or multicritical Rips bifiltrations, as defined in the RIVET paper.  Only tracks the hom_dim-1, hom_dim, and hom_dim+1 -dimensional simplices
